A Reddit wrapper written in GoLang.

This API is here to abstract away all of the REST calls that need
to be made to use the Reddit API.

Rather than having to muck through all of the JSON or XML that the Reddit API returns,
this API will return data structures. This API takes care of parsing the JSON or XML
and quickly and efficiently gives the user the desired information.

The main package gives examples of API usage.

See the official [Reddit API](http://www.reddit.com/dev/api).
